## Time-series-forecast-using-SARIMAX-model

### Synopsis
Time seriesForecast the number of campylobacteriosis cases in Victoria for the next 5 years by wrangling the dataset to have a date time and cases as input variables

### Tech

* [Python](https://pythonprogramminglanguage.com) - build machine learning algorithms!
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org)- open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents.

### Installation

Time series forecast of the data requires  [Python](https://pythonprogramminglanguage.com) v3+ to run.

Install the dependencies or packages by using the following command:
!pip install "package_name" in a cell of the .ipynb file
For Example:
```sh

$ pip install statsmodels
$ pip install matplotlib
```
### Packages
The following are the necessary packages to run the python Source code

 matplotlib<br>
*pandas<br>
*numpy<br>
*arima_model<br>
*sklearn<br>


### Execution
- Download the  necessary input data files such as campylobacter_month.xlsx under the sheet name 'Forecast_model_final' and keep them in the same directory as the implementation .ipynb file
- Import all the necessary packages and libraries
- Proceed running further cells in the .ipynb file
